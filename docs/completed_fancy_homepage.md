- ✅ **Smart Player Cards**: Context-aware CTAs (Sign In vs Create Match)
- ✅ **Enhanced Match History**: Compact cards with player avatars and "vs" layout

- ✅ **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design with touch controls
- ✅ **"Show Don't Tell"**: Visitors immediately see and can interact with Diamond Chess

---

## Original Goals (All Achieved):

"Show don't tell"

When first landing on the homepage, show the same layout that we do for the match page. However it's just a local play version so they can experiment with the layout and pieces.

- ✅ User can move for both sides (game state saved only in short term local memory)
- ✅ Moves follow game rules and alternate turns
- ✅ Local game state refreshes each time (no persistence needed)

I still want to utilize the PlayerIndicators real estate on the homepage board, but the PlayerIndicators would behave differently.

- ✅ The current user should be the White Piece player, if they're not logged in, a CTA to log in. If they are signed in, clicking it would just take them to their profile.

- ✅ The player indicator next to the Black Pieces should instead be a CTA to 'Create a match' (basically saying if you want to play against a real person, click here to create a new match and invite them)

Below the game board demo, I still want to show the user match history. However a few key changes:

- ✅ Make the match history cards more sleek/compact
- ✅ Make the match history cards more visually interesting, show an Avatar of each player (if there is one) against each other with a 'vs' in the middle
- ✅ Remove 'Game #1'
- ✅ Prioritize active matches first, then most recent matches
